# M-ENC - Marshal Encryptor

**M-ENC** is a Termux-based Python tool that can easily encrypt any Python file into `marshal` bytecode.  
After encryption, the original source code cannot be directly viewed, but the file can still be executed.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Quickly converts Python scripts into marshal bytecode.
- Keeps the original source code unchanged.
- Encrypted files can be executed directly with the `python` command.
- Works directly in Termux (no version mismatch issues).

## üì¶ Installation

Run the following commands in Termux:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install python git -y
git clone https://github.com/lucifer-fernandez/M-ENC.git
cd M-ENC
```

üöÄ Usage

In Termux, run:
```bash
python encrypt.py
```
Then:

1. Enter the source file name you want to encrypt (e.g., script.py)


2. Enter the output encrypted file name you want to create (e.g., script_enc.py)
